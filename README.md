Day | Part 1 | Part 2 | Comments
--- | --- | --- | --- 
1 | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | 
2 | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | Brute forced Part 2 because of small range -- no inverse function
3 | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | Cached str rep of points for first wire, did lookups of points in second wire for intersections
4 | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | Decently optimized but could go further by restricting loop range by considering gap value and higher power digit values
